This plug-in generates a /index.json file containing the same posts
as /index.html. Intended to be used in JavaScripts. For example to
promote the most recent posts at the bottom of older posts.

By default, the JSON file will include:
    [
        {
            "date": <JS Date object>,
            "title": <post-title>,
            "loc": <relative-link-to-post>
        },
    ]

Optionally, it can be expanded to include thumbnails or descriptions:
    [ {
        "date" <JS Date object>, "title": <post-title>, "loc": <post-relative-link>,
        "desc": <post-meta-description>,
        "img": <post-meta-thumbnail>
    ], }

Posts are sorted by their post.meta.date as JavaScript dates.

JSON files will also be created for any sections.

Pro tip: Set a sensible cache header for the JSON file.
